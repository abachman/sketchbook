Playing with [L-Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) because I want
to grow fungus.

L-Sytems are hard, so along the way I'm making drawings.

`rulesets.js` includes ruleset definitions. Axioms and angles and whatnot.
`dragon.pde` is a mishmash of Processing and Processing.js that evaluates
rulesets.

`index.html` is just a loading file for the rulesets and L-Systems engine.

You can see the code up and running at
