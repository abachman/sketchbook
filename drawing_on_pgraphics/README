Goal: to draw a single image, tint it three ways, rotate it three ways, and
blend it onto Processing's main canvas, creating a shifting mess of colorful
bubbles.

I'm only drawing one moving image, but you see three copies. The rotations
make it look like the objects are all moving different directions, but

Result:

Processing doesn't have javascript's [globalCompositeOperation](https://developer.mozilla.org/samples/canvas-tutorial/6_1_canvas_composite.html),
so I'm faking it.
