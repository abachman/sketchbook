# This demo shows a simple example of game structure.

#
# * Clock to limit the maximum framerate (to keep CPU usage low)
#
# * Sprites to display player characters on the screen
#
# * EventQueue, EventHandler, and the HasEventHandler mixin to
#   receive events from the keyboard, joystick, etc.
#
# * A custom Game class to integrate it all and provide the game
#   structure and main loop.
